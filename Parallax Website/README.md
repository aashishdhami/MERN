// it's best practice to include whole code in a single super wrapper (container)
// wrapper container ho height define gardine, 100vh
// If we want to have 3D effects on our page, then perspective ni set gardine wrapper ma
// scroll aaye, turn of overflow-x, overflow-y accordingly

// Since text lai center garauna xa, container ma images and text haldine ani teslai diplay flex gardine.
// images lai we can give class to directly select them

// container lai relative handiye positioning, now child lai absolute, aba parent ko relative position & overlap garna milyo

// -> wrapper ko height: 100vh, container is the child of it and container ko height: 100% so 100vh, and again background and fg img ko height is also 100% so tesko positioning context is the parent so height is 100vh as well. So wrapper ko height set gardine, baaki ko ta 100% garerai milxa.
